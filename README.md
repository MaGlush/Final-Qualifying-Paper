# Automated detection of insecure configuration settings of network devices
The thesis analyzes the percentage of IoT devices with default credentials in the Russian Internet segment. Insecure settings are causing an increasing number of IoT devices to be compromised by threat actors. As a result, these devices become the source of subsequent attacks. Therefore, it has been suggested that the lack of public awareness regarding information security hygiene combined with default settings allowed by IoT device manufacturers is the cause of the problem.
